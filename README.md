# IoT Object Detection using YOLOv5
## An object detection model using YOLOv5 to identify and classify IoT components like sensors, microcontrollers, and hardware in real-time.

## Instructions

### Clone the Repository (Terminal)
- cd path_to_your_project
  ```sh
  cd path_to_your_project
  ```
- clone the **IoT_Object_Detection_YOLOv5** repo
  ```sh
